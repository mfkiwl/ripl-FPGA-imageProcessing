It is useful to compile RIPL programs for CPUs to debug algorithms
written in RIPL, before compiling them to Verilog for FPGAs.

To compile a RIPL program to an executable, use the `ripl2c` script.
E.g. to compile the `examples/sobel.ripl` program:

```bash
$ ripl2c examples/sobel.ripl
...
compiling C to an executable /path/to/ripl/sobel ...
```

The executable is the `/path/to/ripl/sobel` file. Run it like so:

```bash
$ ./sobel -i /path/to/my/512x512-image.yuv -w out.yuv -l 1
```

View the image output with `ffplay` like so:

```bash
$ ffplay -video_size 512x512 -pix_fmt gray out.yuv
```

In order to use `ripl2c`, first follow the
[the RIPL installation guide](/install/install-ripl.html).
